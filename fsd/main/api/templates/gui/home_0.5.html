    <p> As investment tools multiply, more people are choosing to manage their own stock portfolios. When
        deciding whether to invest in a company, it helps to have an understanding of that company's financial situation
        such as
        their revenue, assets, and debts. This
        information
        is free for all public companies traded in the U.S. from the <a
            href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is
        difficult to find <i>well formatted and easily comparable</i> data from
        financial statements that is not cost-prohibitive. FinancialStatementData.com was created after one frustrated
        investor built a financial
        statement data aggregator of their own. You can access a company's historic assets, liabilities, cash on hand,
        stockholders' equity and more with your free <a href="#api-key">API Key</a>.</p>
    <p>Get started with the API using the <a href="#code">code examples</a>.
        Read more about the data fields available through the API in the <a href="#data">response data</a> section.

    period per each share of common stock or unit outstanding during the reporting
    period. Diluted earnings per share includes the amount of net income or loss for the
    period available to each share of common stock or common unit outstanding during the
    reporting period and to each share or unit that would have been outstanding assuming
    the issuance of common shares or units for all dilutive potential common shares or
    units outstanding during the reporting period.
</li>

    well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Includes other kinds
    of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits. Also includes

</li>
<li><code>AssetsCurrent</code> - Sum of the carrying amounts as of the balance sheet
    date of all assets that are expected to be realized in cash, sold, or consumed

    which the consolidated financial statements are presented; and (3) changing the

    the hope that such knowledge will be useful in developing a new product or service,
    a new process or technique, or in bringing about a significant improvement to an
    existing product or process; or (2) to translate research findings or other
    knowledge into a plan or design for a new product or process or for a significant
    improvement to an existing product or process whether intended for sale or the
    entity's use, during the reporting period charged to research and development
    projects, including the costs of developing computer software up to the point in
    time of achieving technological feasibility, and costs allocated in accounting for a
    business combination to in-process projects deemed to have no alternative future
    use.
