                            <li><code>Assets</code> - Sum of the carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date of
                                all assets that are recognized. Assets are probable future economic benefits

                                of all liabilities that are recognized. Liabilities are probable future sacrifices
                                of economic benefits arising from present obligations of an entity to transfer
                                assets or provide services to other entities in the future.

                                equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is
                                not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest, minority interest). This
                                excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

                                entity. A change in reporting entity is considered as follows: (1) presenting

                                entities included in the combined financial statements. A business combination
                                accounted for under the purchase method and the consolidation of a variable interest
                                entity are not considered a change in reporting entity.

                                the hope that such knowledge will be useful in developing a new product or service,
                                a new process or technique, or in bringing about a significant improvement to an
                                existing product or process; or (2) to translate research findings or other
                                knowledge into a plan or design for a new product or process or for a significant

                                entity's use, during the reporting period charged to research and development
                                projects, including the costs of developing computer software up to the point in

                                use.
